# Social Media App

## A personal project I've wanted to make

This is a **MERN** stack social media app for fun. Just to make sure that I could make this.

The MERN stack is made up of MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS.

MongoDB handles the database, Express is used for linking the front-end to the back-end, React is for creating the front-end and Node handles the backend. All pretty simple stuff.
